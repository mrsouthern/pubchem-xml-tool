In this assay, HEK293 cells are co-transfected with a DAF12-responsive reporter plasmid (lit1-tk-luc) and expression vectors encoding ssDAF12 and GRIP1. The ability of compounds to increase transcriptional activity is assessed by measuring luciferase expression from the reporter gene plasmid. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 6.8 uM.</Item><Item id="Description-DetailedProtocols">HEK293 cells were routinely cultured in T-175 flasks containing 25 mL of DMEM media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v antibiotic-antimycotic mix at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The day prior to run the assay, the HEK293 cells were harvested using 5 mL of TrypLE reagents and seeded in fresh media at a density of 10 million cells per T175 flask. The following day, cells were transfected with 1 mL of serum-free OptiMEM containing 8 ug of the ssDAF12-expressing vector, 8 ug of the GRIP1-expressing vector, 20 ug of the lit1-tk-luc reporter plasmid and 80 uL of transfection reagent. Twenty four hours post transfection, cells were harvested using 5 mL of preheated TrypLE and resuspended at a concentration of 1 million cells per mL in phenol-red free DMEM supplemented as above. Delta7-dafachronic acid (D7-DA), a well-characterized agonist for ssDAF12, was used as a positive control.
The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of cell suspension into each well of white, solid-bottom 1536-well plates using a flying reagent dispenser (Aurora) and placed in the incubator for 3 hours. Cells were then treated with 34 nL/well of either test compounds, DMSO (Low Control, final concentration 0.68%) or 3 uM of D7-DA (High Control). Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95%RH and then removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes. Luciferase activity was detected by addition of 5 uL of One-Glo reagent to each well. After a 15 minute incubation time, light emission was measured with the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer).</Item><Item id="CalculationSummary">The percent activation of each test compound was calculated as follows:
% Activation = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median__Low_Control ) )
Where:
High_Control is defined as wells treated with 3 uM Delta7 Dafachronic Acid
Low_Control is defined as wells treated with DMSO only.
Test_Compound is defined as wells treated with test compound.

A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally active compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.

The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.</Item><Item id="Curve-fitEquation"></Item><Item id="Keywords">ssDAF12, daf12, daf-12, S. stercoralis,  Caenorhabditis elegans, C. elegans, primary screen, primary, PRUN, lumi, luminescence, HTS, high throughput screen, 1536, Scripps Florida, The Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center, SRIMSC, Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network, MLPCN.</Item><Item id="Comments">Due to the increasing size of the MLPCN compound library, this assay may have been run as two or more separate campaigns, each campaign testing a unique set of compounds. All data reported were normalized on a per-plate basis. Possible artifacts of this assay can include, but are not limited to: dust or lint located in or on wells of the microtiter plate, and compounds that modulate luciferase activity and hence well luminescence.

The developmental stages of these organisms are widely studied [3, 4].  One stage, dauer (German for “duration,” also known as an alternative L3 larval stage) covers an alternative larval stage in which development stops and the worms enter a hibernation-like state in which they can survive extremely harsh environmental conditions, often for years.  In the case of parasitic nematodes, this resting state is quite often the infectious state [5]. As the burden of parasitic nematodes grows in the face of emerging resistance to the few existing antihelminthic agents, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the life cycles of parasitic worms so that new drugs may be developed [1]. The nuclear receptor DAF-12 (for “dauer formation”), first identified in C. elegans, is known to control many nematode species’ entry into and exit from the dauer resting state [6].  Daf-12 belongs to a family of over 30 genes which transduce environmental signals to influence the choice between dauer or reproductive development.  Favorable environments activate insulin/IGF and TGF-beta pathways converge, leading to production of the steroid hormone dafachronic acid (DA), which binds and activates Daf-12 [7].  Currently available antihelminthic agents, to which resistance is beginning to emerge, act primarily on the feeding stages of the worms and have little effect on the infectious stages [8].  Therefore, pharmacologic agonists developed through high-throughput screening would be used both practically as nematicides and academically as tools to characterize the role of DAF-12 in modulating life cycle [8, 9].</Paragraph></ProjectDescription><References><Reference><Text>1.
